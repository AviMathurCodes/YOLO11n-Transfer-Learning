# YOLO11n-Transfer-Learning
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an object detection algorithm that, given an image, pre-
dicts bounding boxes and corresponding class probabilities for objects in a single forward
pass through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Due to this design, YOLO models are
extremely fast and well-suited for real-time object detection tasks.

I have worked with a pre-trained YOLO11n model to perform multi-
object detection and explore the power of transfer learning by fine-tuning YOLO11n on a
new dataset for detecting signatures.
